# Problem Statement
IGC students have trouble using school facilities such as study rooms and the gym. Currently, the students have to reserve the study rooms by signing up on the reservation sheet (paper) before they use them. They do not know if the room is available or not before they go and sign up. The same problem happens with the gym. Students do not know if there is space to play sports unless they go and see. This is a waste of time. Sometimes, students have conflicts with other students as the reservation system is unclear. Our project is will save studentsâ€™ time and reduce conflicts by creating a website that allows students to see the status of facilities and reserve them online.
