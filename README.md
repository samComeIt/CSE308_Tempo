# CSE308

# Problem Statement
Our project is to make a web application that allows the university students to reserve study rooms in dorms and libraries. Now, the students have to reserve the rooms by signing on the reservation sheet (paper) before they use it. They do not know if the room is available or not before they sign up. This can be a waste of time. Sometimes, the students have a conflict with other students as the signing sheet is in both dorms. Our group is trying to make the website that allows the students to reserve the rooms by checking the room status online.
